            <h1 className='about-name'>Hi, I'm Sehaj</h1>
            <p className='about-p1'>I'm a third-year Software Engineering student at Western University interested in areas of software engineering like full stack development, 
                databases, continous integration, problem-solving, communication, and building high-quality applications using different programming 
                languages. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, going to the gym, playing tennis, and socializing.</p>
            <p className='about-p2'>I have worked on many projects through coursework and personal projects that have improved myself as a software engineer. Some of these 
                include CapicConnect iOS app, Music Web App, and more which you can check out in my resume. As a team lead for my university club, I 
                learned how to manage a team of developers through effective communication and problem-solving. I am looking to contribute my skills and 
                experiences to a forward-thinking company where I can build real-world solutions and improve myself.</p>
